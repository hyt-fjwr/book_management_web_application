# book_management_web_application

This is my very first web application project using Java and Spring Framework.<br>
Through making this program I learned what MVC model is and rough flow of the data transmission of DB and Web page.<br>
Also I tried to the dynamic page usign JavaScript and I think it went pretty well.<br>
But I didn't make it responsive web page so I want to make FULL responsive web site next time.
